Time-domain quantum and classical state-space representation in Python

Features
* Run and simulate arbitrary state-space models with time
* Infer a state-space representation from the frequency-domain transfer function
* TODO Find a physically realizable quantum state-space for a given transfer function 

To setup dev environment:

    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

TODO
====

* Measure transfer function of system in time domain
* Find physical realization from transfer function
